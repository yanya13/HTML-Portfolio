    <p align = center>The movie is absolutely the best feel good movies of all time that I've watched. The cute and adorable story of LaraJean Covey and Peter Kavinsky and her 3 sisters is a treat to watch.</p>
    <li><h3><u>Fifty Shades of Grey</u></h3></li>

    <p align = "center">The movie is actually great as someone might believe it of a more adult side. But I don't see it as that. It's the perfect blend of dominating Christian Grey and his cute romantic side; but the new bright fresh out of college graduate Anastasia Steele about to find her love.</p>
    <li><h3><u>Jab We Met</u></h3></li>
    <img src = "https://i.gifer.com/FS7E.gif" height = "200" width = "700s" />
    <p align = "center">A classic romantic-comedy of bollywood about two strangers who meet during the most unexpected journey and eventually fall in love. The sweet and hopeful and chirpy girl called Geet and a little bit of our handsome, rich yet depressed hero Aditya, a guy who learns how to live life from geet. Together they both deliver a story to the screens and masses that tell us a lot about the different shades of life and how to deal with them.</p></ol>
